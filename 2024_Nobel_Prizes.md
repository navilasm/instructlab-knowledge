# 2024 Nobel Prizes

The 2024 Nobel Prizes were awarded by the Nobel Foundation, based in Sweden. Six categories were awarded: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, Peace, and Economic Sciences. The winners in each category were announced from October 7 to October 14.
Nobel Week was scheduled to take place from December 6 to 12, including programming such as lectures, dialogues, and discussions. The award ceremony and banquet for the Peace Prize were scheduled in Oslo on December 10, while the award ceremony and banquet for all other categories were scheduled for the same day in Stockholm.

From November 30 to December 8, the Nobel Prize Museum set up citywide illuminations across Stockholm. On December 8, as well, opera singer Malin Byström and conductor Petr Popelka performed at the Nobel Prize Concert. The menu for the Nobel Banquet, scheduled for December 10, was set by chef Jessie Sommarström and pastry chef Frida Bäcke.


## Controversies


### Physics

Hinton's awarding of the Prize in Physics, for research on machine learning, provoked debates about the lack of recognition for computation and mathematics in the Nobel Foundation's categories. Some saw Hinton's work as crucial but not traditionally in line with physics.

## Economic Sciences

The Atlantic called the Prize in Economic Sciences in 2024 to be one of the most controversial in recent history. Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson's work was criticized by historians and social scientists for inaccurately describing and analyzing history, neglecting the role of colonization in nation-building, and reflecting the insularity of economics as a discipline, among other critiques.
